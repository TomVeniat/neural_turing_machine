# Test

To test a pre-trained model on a specific task, just run the associated file :
 * Copy task : `load_copy.lua`
 * Repeat copy task : `load_rep_copy.lua`
 * Association recall task : `load_assoc.lua`

Three plots will pop : 
 1. The randomly sampled inputs.
 2. The outputs generated by the Neural Turing Machine.
 3. The difference between the expected outputs and the actual outputs.
 
#TO DO :
* Enhance Shifter module performances (caching shiftMat allows to reduce execution time by half).
* Implement a the GRU controller.
* Make training parameters configuration easier.
